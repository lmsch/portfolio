## Tic-Tac-Toe Android App (UPEI project)

This app is a tic-tac-toe game. The app, when launched, directs the user to a start screen. They select the options "1 Player" or "2 Players". The user is then redirected to a tic-tac-toe board. The game displays the current turn (player 1 is always 'X', player 2 is always 'O'). A user clicks on one of the buttons to place their symbol, and the game moves on to the next turn. If the game is in 1 player mode, the AI (who plays as player 2) will make its turn after a small pause. If three symbols appear in a row, the game will display an alert dialog, telling the user who won or if there was a tie. The user can then choose to start a new game in the current mode or return to the start screen.

For further documentation, see comments in code.
