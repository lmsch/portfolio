## Revitalize Virtual Wellness System

This was an 8 month final project for my degree. A professor at UPEI planned on running a 12 week program to promote healthy practices for COPD/heart disease patients. A team of 5 students, myself included, was tasked with building a health companion web app for this program. Our team met with the client and project manager regularly to gather requirements and demo prototypes. Upon completion of a project plan, we proceeded with 5 months of development. As the technical lead of this project, I was reponsible for planning our system architecture, preparing our development environment, and writing frontend code. Our stack:  

* React.js with Redux
* Django HTTP API with Django REST Framework
* OAuth Resource Owner Password Flow

Our final MVP included:
* A web app that allowed patients to view their profile summary and lab value history. They could also fill out standardized surveys and view their survey scores. History pages included graphs for data visualization.
* An admin site for managing users. It could also be used to add new surveys and lab values to the system.

About 95% of the React app was written by me, as the other four devs mostly worked on the Django API. See the [VWS frontend repo](https://github.com/lmsch/revitalize-vws-app) README for more information on how the app was written.
